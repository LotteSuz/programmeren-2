# Module 8: Hangman

In this module, you'll implement a game while learning about object-oriented programming. This style of programming isn't available in C, but in Python, many people use it!

## Grading

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems below, your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for "quality", and provide you with some written feedback. This week, your programs will be primarily graded on:

- [Magic numbers](/quality/magic-numbers)
- [Loops](/quality/loops)
- [Duplication](/quality/duplication)
- [Nesting](/quality/nesting)

And we'll also take these into account from last week: [comments](/quality/comments), [naming](/quality/naming), [indentation](/quality/indentation), [whitespace](/quality/whitespace).


## What to Do

#### 1. Preparation

1. Watch a video about [the idea](https://www.lynda.com/Python-tutorials/Object-oriented-thinking/731735/5002881-4.html) behind object-oriented programming.

1. Watch a video about the basics of [object-oriented programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apACNr7DC_s).

#### 2. Game of Cards

1. If you haven't yet, create an account at [GitHub](https://github.com/join). For now, you'll only need it to access the Game of Cards exercises, but in later courses you'll be submitting your programs on this website!

1. Practice with [Game of Cards](https://lab.cs50.io/minprog/programmeren-2/master/problems/cards/lab).

#### 3. More preparation

Watch:

- Intro to object-oriented programming in Python, [part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYYzteRKU7U)

- Optionally, intro to object-oriented programming in Python, [part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umpt43ZzmqM)

#### 4. Hangman

Implement either of:

- [Lovely Hangman](/problems/hangman2)

- [Evil Hangman](/problems/hangman) (Hacker)

#### 5. Submit

You can submit your solutions on the problem pages linked above. Before submitting, keep in mind the course's policy on [academic honesty](/syllabus#samenwerken-fraude-en-plagiaat) (like plagiarism).
