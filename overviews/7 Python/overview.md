## Grading

As soon as you have submitted working solutions for all problems below, your mentor will assess your programs, assign a grade for "quality", and provide you with some written feedback. This week, your programs will be primarily graded on:

This week we focus on:

- [Comments](/quality/comments)
- [Naming](/quality/naming)
- [Indenting code](/quality/indentation)
- [Whitespace](/quality/whitespace)

Don't forget to use `style50` to automatically suggest corrections for indentation and whitespace! However, `style50` is a very simple tool, so do not depend on it too much.
